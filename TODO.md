# Fix Infinite Scroll Functionality

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Fix infinite-scroll-client.tsx by memoizing loadMorePosts function with useCallback
- [x] Update blog page to pass initialHasMore state to client component
- [x] Update InfiniteScrollClient to accept and use initialHasMore prop
- [x] Fix paginatedPostsQuery GROQ syntax to use correct slice range [$offset...$offset + $limit]
- [x] Fix blog page to properly pass initialHasMore prop (was commented out)
- [ ] Test the infinite scroll behavior
- [ ] Verify the error is resolved

## Current Status:
All code fixes have been implemented. The infinite scroll component should now work correctly with proper server-side pagination and client-side state management.
